After reading over the results and adding  those results to a graph in google sheets it is obvious that .unshift gets exponentially worse with the more amount of data that is passed in. where as appending it onto the end does a much better job and is only linear. This makes sense as the bigger the data amount for unshift or inserting into the beginning of the array means a lot of moving information whereas just adding to the end is fairly linear and is a lot less work. The amount of time for insert to take in the extra large array was much longer than adding to the end. It is interesting to note that on small data inputs there was hardly a difference between unshift and push.
